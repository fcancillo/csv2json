A simple Python script that converts CSV files to JSON.
Upon startup, a pop-up window allows the user to select one or more files to convert.
Once selected, an output file with the same name is created for each input file, containing the data in JSON format.
It's assumed that the input CSV file contains the column names on the first line. These names will be the labels for each element in the JSON file.
